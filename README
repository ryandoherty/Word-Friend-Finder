Word Friend Finder!

Calculates social network size of words in dictionary that have a Levenshtein distance of 1.

Problem:
Two words are friends if they have a Levenshtein distance (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) of 1. That is, you can add, remove, or substitute exactly one letter in word X to create word Y. A word's social network consists of all of its friends, plus all of their friends, and all of their friends' friends, and so on. Write a program to tell us how big the social network for the word "causes" is, using this word list (https://raw.github.com/causes/puzzles/master/word_friends/word.list).

Usage: enter a word, click 'Find friends', wait. Profit!
